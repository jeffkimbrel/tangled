```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jeffkimbrel/tangled")
```

Further, `tangled` relies on the `pwalign` package from bioconductor. To install, run the following.

```r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("pwalign")
```
